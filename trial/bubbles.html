                    <h4>The Problem</h4>
                    <p>Many people who have generalized anxiety disorder also suffer from catastropic thinking as a product of their anxiety. People with this disorder often do not have the resources to distance themselves from their fears.</p>
                    <h4>The Goal</h4>
                    <p>Support people with generalized axiety disorder by giving them a way to sort out their catastrophized scenario even when a medical professional is not immediately available.</p>
                   <h4>Why it is important</h4>
                   <p>While there are resources to help people manage their anxiety, much of therapy relies of people practicing outside of sessions. By giving people support tools, it can alleviate feeling completely alone when one does not have access to a therapist. Catastrophic thinking can lead to terrifying behaviors and thoughts: any impact we can make is important.</p>
                   <h4>My Role</h4>
                   <p>This was a special project for me because I came up with the distancing idea: having a background in cognitive science, I could see psychological concepts come to life. I also was the sole developer on this team and had never created a mobile application before. I learned so much, and we were one of the winners for this month long hackathon!</p>

                        <p>Do you feel your anxiety bubbling to the surface? Do you tend to catastrophize and think of the worst-case scenario? You are not alone. Try Bubbles, a self-help mobile application that lets you express your emotions freely and supports your mental wellbeing. Bubbles is here as a virtual friend to listen, be a part of your struggles and help you take a step back and put your situation into perspective. Let's dive into it!</p>
                        <p>Girls in Tech has always been a promoter of bridging the gaps in our society for marginalized groups, particularly women in technology. Sponsored by Nike, the Girls in Tech Mental Health Hackathon was meant to enter the mental health industry and see how we can empower the public, particularly marginalized groups, to give themselves the resources to deal with such a stigmatized group. Girls in Tech supported this feat by investing in the technical abilities of women. Each team must be majority female and would have to tackle a mental health issue, one that would support not only those who suffer from mental health issues, but those who are marginalized from mental health help.</p>

                        <p>Based on our limited time frame, we knew we had to pick a topic quickly, so we brainstormed ideas for services based on the categories in the hackathon writeup:</p>
                        <p>
                            <ol>

                            </ol>
                        </p>
                        <p>Because mental health was the main focus of the hackathon and we saw it as an opportunity to include aspects of the other categories, we eventually decided on mental health as our main focus.</p>

                <h3>The Process</h3>
                <p>Once we had our domain, we could start doing research into our problem space. We had about 2 and a half weeks to go from the inception of our idea through research, design, development, and pitching the idea, so we wanted to maximize our time. For user research, we wanted to talk to both experts in the field about how we could make an impact and people who actually suffer from this disorder. On top of this in-the-field research, we also did a lot of desk research to make sure that we had the literature’s backing in our ideas.</p>
                <p>We started with 4 semi structured interviews with people who had been diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder and suffered from the symptom of catastropic thinking.</p>
                <div class="standalonePic">
                    <img src="./bubblesImgs/bubblesAffinity.png" />
                </div>
                <div class="imgSplit">
                    <p class="splitParas insightsImg">Talking to people who could openly share about a mental disorder was an eye opening experience. It made us feel that this threat was very tangible, so we affinity mapped our four interviews with our future user base, and compared it the notes with our expert interview. We interviewed Mark Seery from the University at Buffalo, SUNY, who specializes in social psychology in the realm of stress management. His insight helped us converge on 3 main insights:</p>

                <div class="imgSplit">
                    <div class="splitParas">
                        <p>We also determined that there are 4 main triggers for catastrophic thinking:</p>
                        <p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Ambiguous situations</li>
                                <li>The worry about high stake goals or motivations</li>
                                <li>Things that make us afraid</li>
                                <li>When one feels rundown or depleted</li>
                            </ol>
                        </p>
                        <p>We knew that making people more aware of which category they fell into would make them gain better control over their situation.</p>
                        <p>BTo empathize with our users we took all we had learned from our research both about anxiety from the literature and anxiety from real people, we created an empathy map. This empathy map helped us to start brainstorming our ideas for what an app could contain.</p>

                            <p>Next, we had to actually figure out what we wanted to prototype. With more research, we learned that a major tactic for dealing anxiety was fictionalization, a means of distancing the person from the thing that makes them anxious.</p>
                            <p>We then thought about what fictionalization would not be so obtrusive that someone spiraling into a catastropic line of thinking would not want to use it, but light enough to make a difference.</p>
                            <p>Here was my first big contribution. I came up with the connections to madlibs. In madlibs, we take ordinary stories and fill them in with ridiculous words that make our mundane lives a little sillier. I thought of doing the same thing here. If we take the person’s current situation and add in a few silly words, we can add an element of fictionalization that distances the person from the problem enough to take a step back.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="img">

                    <div class="imgSplit">
                        <div class="splitParas">
                            <p>At first, we imagined the madlibs to be a small portion of the app, which would mainly use self affirmation as the main psychological player. We wanted to affirm users of their best qualities, hopefully detracting from the threatneing aspects of whatever anxiety inducing situation they were facing.</p>
                            <p>We were very glad we tested this at the low fidelity level, because our user testing failed miserably. Users explained that this kitchy excuse for a mental health app was precisely why they avoided talking to people about their problems. They expressed that hearing fake-happy encouragement from people who did not understand their problems actually isolated them even more, demotivating them from getting any help.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="img">

                            <p>The first big change we wanted to make was that we should provide a more factual explanation for what was happening to people. While we know that we cannot be therapists, we can provide a generalized explanation to give people something that they can understand on a basic level.</p>
                            <p>Here, we are including the 4 major triggers of catastropic thinking and we started to give users a place to interact, framing our application as a diary app more than a self-help app. We also made the madlibs the center of the app.</p>
                            <p>But, we were still making a lot of design decisions. In this iteration, we were going to mirror MadLibs, very closely, asking users to pick a setting and nouns and verbs, but this was too much for users, who just wanted to express their feelings.</p>

                            <p>We then rapidly began prototyping, I mainly worked on the interaction with the interface. As we pivoted towards a diary-esque app, we realized that the duality of talking to people both inducing and lessening the weight of anxiety could play to our advantage. A chatbot was the answer. It is not so personalized that users would feel embarassed to talk to it, but it also feels like someone listening.</p>

                            <p>Finally, we knew how to properly incorporate the idea I had all those days ago, we could focus on just one distancing word at a time. This found the right balance between fictionalization and focusing on the problem.</p>
                            <p>We had users explain why they are anxious, forcing them to express their worries. This in an of itself can be helpful, but we wanted to push them even farther from the situation, so we ask users to pick a silly word. Then, users must use that silly world to re-explain why they are anxious. For example, if the word is Shakira, it is pretty difficult to find an explanation that justifies freaking out in the same way as before.</p>
                            <p>We found that users appreciated the break in their own close-minded way of thinking, which is precisely what the research had suggested.</p>
                            <p>As a final addition, users expressed that seeing evidence that they had escaped earlier episodes of catastrophizing, so we created explicit stories that users could revisit.</p>

              <div class="imgSplit">
                <div class="splitParas">
                    <p>Our final solution was also a process because I had never built a mobile application before. Being the sole developer on the team, I had no choice but to learn quickly. At first I tried a Kivy application from Python, but this did not have enough customization for the look of the application. Because there was not meant to be an intense backend, we wanted to make sure that this was accessible to people on all platforms and pleasing to look at. The hackathon also did not explicitly require a coding component, so we knew that the design had to shine through even though our main goal was to bring the app to life.</p>

                    <p>Next, I found the framework that would be most appropriate, and I would end up using it for the rest of the project. React Native is very similar to React, but with a few difficult differences. I knew what I was doing on the minimal backend used: it has the same applications, using hooks, state, and a render function, but the way that rendering works did not match the web.</p>
                    <p>As one might imagine, because an app does not have a DOM, it was a rude awakening to learn that things were not set up as I imagined, I learned that there is far more one has to do to understand how things should be positioned on the page.</p>

That being said, I am so proud to show off this one because it highlights that more than anything that I love learning. </p>

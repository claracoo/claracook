  <h3>Bad Seed</h3>
  <p>Bad Seed is an artificial intelligence based autonomous scheduler used at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) in the National Synchrotron Lightsource II. As with the majority of technology used at BNL, there is no such thing as “optimized enough”. The only thing holding back science is time and resources, so, by working on this project, I hoped to mitigate some of those limitations.</p>

  <h3>Twother</h3>
  <p>People are often unaware of the fact that they are surrounded by only one perspective and become stuck in an echo chamber. In this project, we wanted to understand how we might raise awareness about echo chambers among Twitter users and encourage them to break out of them. We then developed Twother, a chrome extension that brings users awareness of different echo chamber experiences.</p>
